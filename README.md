<p align="center"><strong>Creating and manipulating binary trees</strong></p>

<p align="justify">A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children themselves are binary trees, making it a recursive data structure. Binary trees are employed in various applications, including database indexing, expression parsing, and organizing hierarchical data like file systems and folder structures.</p>
